# Memory in Operating System


**Members:**
* John Mark A. Gomez (Leader)
* John Patrick Marnel Gasang (Rapporteur)

**Description of the Project:**

In an Operating System (OS), Memory management has a task that handles the multiple processes back and forth between main memory and disk during execution. The memory needs to be allocated efficiently to pack as many processes into memory as possible. By assigning portions in memory known as blocks to various running programs to enhance the overall performance of the system.
